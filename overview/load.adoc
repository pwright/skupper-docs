= Skupper load-balancing and failover

Skupper allows you balance traffic across servers and fail over between servers located across the application network.

You can configure the network so that a specific location handles all traffic until failure. 
After failure at that location, all traffic is handled by a different location. 
To achieve this behavior, you set the cost from the client to the backup server high as described in {cost-link}.

To configure balancing traffic between locations, you set the cost between the clients and the server locations to be equal.
However, it is important to note that traffic is measured in terms of concurrent TCP connections, so do not expect 'round robin' behavior.
