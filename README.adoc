= Skupper Documentation

This repo is used to document Skupper.

The layout of files in the repo is:

* `{location-chapters}` contains feature specific documentation, eg see `{location-chapters}/cli` for CLI documentation.
* `{location-images}` contains the image files used in the documentation.
* `{location-artifacts}` contains partial files used in the documentation, for example `attributes.adoc`.


The following directories contain auto-generated content, do not edit files directly. 
Instead, edit the contents of the `{location-chapters}` directory.

* `modules` contains autogenerated sections of documentation, one file per section.
* `assemblies` contains autogenerated AsciiDoc files that `include` modules to recreate the contents of `{location-chapters}`.

== Contributing to the documentation

This section explains how to edit and create documentation PRs.
If you only want to make a small update, you might want to just edit the file and make the PR using your standard process.
If you are familiar with Antora, you can use the `preview-playbook.yml` directly.
If you want to preview changes for more complex contributions, follow this procedure.
