=== Creating a gateway and applying it on a different machine

If you have access to a cluster from one machine but want to create a gateway to the {service-network} from a different machine, you can create the gateway definition on the first machine and later apply that definition from a second machine as described in this procedure.

.Procedure

. Log into your cluster from the first machine and change to the namespace for your site.

. Create a Skupper gateway without associating it with the current machine by specifying the `downloadonly` option:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ skupper gateway init --downloadonly
----

. Create a service that can communicate on the {service-network}:
+
--
----
$ skupper service create <name> <port>
----

where 

* `<name>` is the name of the service you want to create
* `<port>` is the port the service uses

For example:

----
$ skupper service create mydb 3306
----
--

. Bind the service on the {service-network}:
+
--
----
$ skupper gateway bind <service> <host> <port>
----

* <service> - the name of the service on the {service-network}, `mydb` in the example above.
* <host> - the host that runs the service.
* <port> - the port the service is running on, `3306` from the example above.

NOTE: No communication is possible at this point, the gateway definition needs to be applied from the actual host before the service is available on the {service-network}.
--

. Download the gateway definition:
+
--
----
$ skupper gateway download <destination-directory>
----

where:

* <destination-directory> - the location where you want to save the resulting gateway definition, for example `~/gateways`.

--

. Copy the gateway defintion file, for example, `mylaptop-jdoe.tar.gz` to the machine that hosts the service you want to expose on the {service-network}.

. From the machine that hosts the service you want to expose:
+
----
$ mkdir gateway
$ tar -xvf <gateway-defintion-file>
$ cd gateway
$ sh ./launch.py
$ systemctl --user status <gateway-definition-name>
----
+
NOTE: You can later remove the gateway using `./remove.py`.

. From the machine with cluster access, check the status of Skupper gateways:
+
--
----
$ skupper gateway status
Gateway Definitions Summary

NAME    BINDS  FORWARDS  URL                    
<machine-name>  1      0         amqp://127.0.0.1:5672 
----
This shows that there is only one exposed service and that service is only exposing a single port (BIND). There are no ports forwarded to the local host.
--

NOTE: If you need to change the gateway definition, for example to change port, you need to remove the existing gateway and repeat this procedure from the start to redefine the gateway.
