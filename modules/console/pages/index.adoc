= Using the {skupper-name} console

include::{mod-loc}preface.adoc[]

By default, when you create a {skupper-name} site, you also enable the {skupper-name} console.
The {skupper-name} console URL is displayed whenever you check site status using `skupper status`.


// Type: procedure
[id="accessing-console"] 
== Accessing the Skupper console

By default, the Skupper console is available whenever you create a {service-network} router and is protected by credentials available in the `skupper-console-users` secret.


.Procedure

. Determine the Skupper console URL using the `skupper` CLI, for example:
+
----
$ skupper status
Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
The site console url is:  https://skupper-west.apps-crc.testing
----

. Browse to the Skupper console URL. 
The credential prompt depends on how the site was created using `skupper init`:
+
* using the `--console-auth unsecured` option, you are not prompted for credentials.
* using the `--console-auth openshift` option, you are prompted to enter OpenShift cluster credentials.
* using the default or `--console-user <user>  --console-password <password>` options, you are prompted to enter {skupper-name} credentials.

. If you created the site using default settings, that is `skupper init`, a random password is generated for the `admin` user.
To retrieve the password:

.. Retrieve the encoded password for the `admin` user:
+
----
$ oc get secret skupper-console-users -o yaml| grep admin

admin: Sk5aV3pNSHR5Zw==
----
.. Decode the password for the `admin` user:
+
----
$ echo -n "Sk5aV3pNSHR5Zw==" | base64 --decode

// Type: procedure
[id="linking-sites-using-skupper-console"] 
== Linking sites using the {skupper-name} console

The {skupper-name} console allows you create and use claim type tokens as described in {CliLink}.

.Prerequisites

* Two sites, each with {skupper-name} console enabled

.Procedure

NOTE: Your browser may prompt you to allow using the clipboard. You must accept that prompt for this procedure.

. Log into the console for the first site.

. Navigate to *Site* in left hand menu.

. Click *Link a remote site* to display the steps for linking.

. Click *Copy a token to the clipboard*.

. Log into the console for the second site.

. Navigate to *Site* in left hand menu.

. Click *Use a token* to accept the token from the first site.

. Verify that the sites are linked by clicking *Deployments* and checking that both sites are listed.



// Type: procedure
[id="exploring-console"] 
== Exploring the Skupper console

The Skupper console provides an overview of the following:

* Services - services that are exposed on the {service-network}, both local and remote.
* Sites - {skupper-name} installations on the current {service-network}.
* Deployments - deployments relating to exposed services.

The Skupper console also provides useful networking information about the {service-network}, for example, traffic levels between sites.

. Perform the {OpenShiftTutorialLink} tutorial.

. Navigate to the Skupper console.

. Click the *Sites* menu item.
Both the *east* and *west* sites should be displayed in circles.

. Drag and drop the *west* circle to be on the left of the *east* circle.

. Click the *Table* tab to display the sites as text items.
This view allows you drill down into details relating to the selected site.

. Click the *Deployments* menu item.
This view shows you any deployments that are exposed as services on the {service-network}.
In this case, the console displays the *hello-world-backend (east)* deployment.

. Click the *Services* menu item to display details for all services exposed on the {service-network}.
+
NOTE: Although two services are involved in the tutorial, only one service, `hello-world-backend` is exposed on the {service-network}.

. Click the *Sites* menu again and expand the panel on the right hand side of the console.
This panel shows the traffic flows from the backend to the frontend.
