== Accessing the {skupper} console

By default, the {skupper} console is available whenever you create a {service-network} router and is protected by credentials available in the `skupper-console-users` secret.


.Procedure

. Determine the {skupper} console URL using the `skupper` CLI, for example:
+
----
$ skupper status
Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
The site console url is:  https://skupper-controller-west.apps-crc.testing
----

. Browse to the {skupper} console URL. The credential prompt depends on how the site was created:
+
* using the `--console-auth unsecured` option, you are not prompted for credentials.
* using the `--console-auth openshift` option, you are prompted to enter OpenShift cluster credentials.
* using the default or `--console-user <user>  --console-password <password>` options, you are prompted to enter {skupper} credentials.

. If you created the site using default settings, that is `skupper init`, a random password is generated for the `admin` user.
To retrieve the password:

.. Retrieve the encoded password for the `admin` user:
+
----
$ oc get secret skupper-console-users -o yaml| grep admin

admin: Sk5aV3pNSHR5Zw==
----
.. Decode the password for the `admin` user:
+
----
$ echo -n "Sk5aV3pNSHR5Zw==" | base64 --decode

== Exploring the {skupper} console

The {skupper} console provides an overview of the following:

* Services - services that are exposed on the {service-network}, both local and remote.
* Sites - {skupper} installations on the current {service-network}.
* Deployments - deployments relating to exposed services.
