== {skupper-name} overview


* Create a service in one cluster and consume it on a different cluster.
* Create a database service on a host and query it from multiple clusters without opening a port

To allow services communicate across clusters, you use either the Skupper CLI or operator to create sites. A _site_ is a namespace in a Kubernetes cluster. 
To connect sites into a {service-network} you use either the Skupper CLI or console to exchange tokens.

To extend the {service-network} beyond Kubernetes, the Skupper CLI allows you create a _gateway_. For example, you can run a database on Linux host and query it from a front end service running on a cluster.

{skupper-name} has been tested on:

* RHEL 8 for Skupper gateways
* OpenShift Container Platform 4.7 to 4.10 for {skupper-name} sites
