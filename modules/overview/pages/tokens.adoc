= Using Skupper tokens

Skupper tokens allow you create links between sites.
You create a token on one site and use that token from the other site to create a link between the two sites.

NOTE: Although the linking process is directional, the link allows communication in both directions.

If both sites are equally accessible, for example two public clouds, then it not important where the token is created.
However, when using a token, the site you are linking to must be accessible from the site you are linking from.
For example, if you are creating a {service-network} using both a public and private cluster, you must create the token on the public cluster and use the token from the private cluster.

There are two types of Skupper token:
