= Securing a {service-network}

include::{mod-loc}preface.adoc[]

By default, {skupper-name} includes many security features.
If you apply the {policy-system} to a cluster, all {service-network} communication to and from that cluster is denied, and you can specify granular policies to allow your {service-network} operate.

{skupper-name} provides default, built-in security that scales across clusters and clouds. 
In a {service-network}, the communication between sites is performed by {skupper-router}s and is secured with mutual TLS using a private, dedicated certificate authority (CA). 
Each {skupper-router} is uniquely identified by its own certificate.
This means that the {service-network} is isolated from external access, preventing security risks such as lateral attacks, malware infestations, and data exfiltration.
The {policy-system} adds another layer at a cluster level to help a cluster administrator control access to a {service-network}.                                                                                                  


// Type: concept
[id="about-skupper-policies"] 
== About the {policy-system}

After installing the {policy-system} Custom Resource Definition (CRD), you need to configure one or more of the following items using custom resources (CRs) to enable communication:

Allow incoming links:: Use `allowIncomingLinks` to enable users create tokens and configure incoming links.

Allow outgoing links to specific hosts:: Use `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames` to specify hosts that users can create links to.

Allow services:: Use `allowedServices` to specify which services can be created or used on the {service-network}.

Allow resources to be exposed:: Use `allowedExposedResources` to specify which resources can be exposed on the {service-network}.

NOTE: Each setting for the {policy-system} can be applied to one or more namespaces.

For example, the following policy CR fully allows all {skupper-name} capabilities on all namespaces, except for exposed resources and a restriction on hostnames for outgoing links.
The policy allows outgoing links to any domain ending in `.example.com` and adds 'deployment/nginx' to the list of allowed resources on all namespaces.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: cluster-policy-sample-01
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowIncomingLinks: true
  allowedExposedResources:
    - "deployment/nginx"
  allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames: [".*\\.example.com$"]
  allowedServices:
    - "*"
----

[NOTE]
====
You can apply many policy CRs and the most permissive policies are enforced.
For example, if you apply a separate policy CR with the line `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames: []`, outgoing links to `*.example.com` are still permitted.
====

`namespaces`:: One or more patterns to specify the namespaces that this policy applies to.
Note that you can use link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/[Label selectors] to match the namespaces.

`allowIncomingLinks`:: Specify `true` or `false` to determine whether other sites can create links to the namespaces specified.
If set to `false` you cannot create tokens or use the gateway features from this site.

`allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames`:: Specify one or more patterns to determine which hosts you can create links to from the namespaces specified.

`allowedServices`:: Specify one or more patterns to determine the permitted names of services allowed on the {service-network} from the namespaces specified.

`allowedExposedResources`:: Specify one or more permitted names of resources allowed on the {service-network} from the namespaces specified. 
Note that patterns are not supported. 

[TIP]
====
Use regular expressions to create pattern matches, for example:

* `.*\\.com$` matches any string ending in `.com`.
A double back slash is required to avoid issues in YAML.
* `^abc$` matches the string `abc`.

====

If you create another CR that allows outgoing links for a specific namespace, a user can create a link from that namespace to join a {service-network}, that is, the logic for multiple policy CRs is `OR`.
{skupper-name} allows operations if one or more of the policy CRs permits the operation.

// Type: procedure
[id="installing-crd"] 
== Installing the {policy-system} CRD

Install the {policy-system} CRD enables a cluster administrator enforce policies for {service-network}s.

NOTE: If there are existing sites on the cluster, see xref:installing-crd-existing-sites[]

.Prerequisites

* Access to a cluster using a `cluster-admin` account
* The Skupper operator is installed

.Procedure

. Log into the cluster using a `cluster-admin` account.

. Download the CRD.

. Apply the CRD:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ kubectl apply -f skupper_cluster_policy_crd.yaml

customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/skupperclusterpolicies.skupper.io created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/skupper-service-controller created
----


. To verify that the {policy-system} is active, use the `skupper status` command and check that the output includes the following line:
+
[source,bash]
----
Skupper is enabled for namespace "<namespace>" in interior mode (with policies).
----


// Type: procedure
[id="upgrading-existing-sites"] 
== Upgrading on a cluster with existing sites

If you are upgrading sites from {skupper-name} version 0.8, you can take advantage of the lack of {policy-system} in that version and avoid {service-network} disruption.

.Procedure

. Document each service and exposed resources.

. Create policy CRs as described in xref:creating-policies[]

. Install the CRD as described in xref:installing-crd[].

. Grant permissions to read policies to developers to avoid that site being blocked from the {service-network}.
+
--
For each site namespace:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding skupper-service-controller-<namespace> --clusterrole=skupper-service-controller --serviceaccount=<namespace>:skupper-service-controller
----

where `<namespace>` is the site namespace.
--


// Type: procedure
[id="installing-crd-existing-sites"] 
== Installing the {policy-system} CRD on a cluster with existing sites

If the cluster already hosts {skupper-name} sites, note the following before installing the CRD:

* All existing connections are closed. 
You must apply a policy CR to reopen connections
* All existing {service-network} services and exposed resources are removed. 
You must create those resources again.

NOTE: If you are upgrading sites from {skupper-name} version 0.8, you can take advantage of the lack of {policy-system} in that version and avoid {service-network} disruption by following the procedure described in xref:upgrading-existing-sites[].

.Procedure

To avoid disruption:

. Plan the CRD deployment for an appropriate time.

. Search your cluster for sites:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector=app=skupper
----

. Document each service and resources exposed on the {service-network}.

. Install the CRD as described in xref:installing-crd[].
This step closes connections and removes all {service-network} services and exposed resources.

. If {skupper-name} sites exist in the cluster not created by `cluster-admin`, you must grant permissions to read policies to developers to avoid that site being blocked from the {service-network}.
+
--
For each site namespace:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding skupper-service-controller-<namespace> --clusterrole=skupper-service-controller --serviceaccount=<namespace>:skupper-service-controller
----

where `<namespace>` is the site namespace.
--


. Create policy CRs as described in xref:creating-policies[]

. Recreate any services and exposed resources as required.


// Type: procedure
[id="creating-policies"] 
== Creating policies for the {policy-system}

Policies allow you control communication across the {service-network} from a cluster.


.Prerequisites

* Access to a cluster using a `cluster-admin` account
* The {policy-system} CRD is installed on the cluster

.Procedure

NOTE: Typically, you create a policy CR that combines many elements from the steps below, for example, see xref:about-skupper-policies[]

. xref:allowIncomingLinks[]
. xref:allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames[]
. xref:allowedServices[]
. xref:allowedExposedResources[]

// Type: procedure
[id="allowIncomingLinks"] 
=== Implement a policy to allow incoming links

Use `allowIncomingLinks` to enable users create tokens and configure incoming links.

.Procedure

. Determine which namespaces you want to apply this policy to.
. Create a CR with `allowIncomingLinks` set to `true` or `false`.
. Create and apply the CR.

For example, the following CR allows incoming links for all namespaces: 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: allowIncomingLinks
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowIncomingLinks: true
----




// Type: procedure
[id="allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames"] 
=== Implement a policy to allow outgoing links to specific hosts

Use `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames` to specify hosts that users can create links to.

. Determine which namespaces you want to apply this policy to.
. Create a CR with `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames` set to a pattern of allowed hosts.
. Create and apply the CR.

For example, the following CR allows links to all subdomains of `example.com` for all namespaces: 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames: ['.*\\.example\\.com']
----


// Type: procedure
[id="allowedServices"] 
=== Implement a policy to allow specific services

Use `allowedServices` to specify which services can be created or used on the {service-network}.

.Procedure

. Determine which namespaces you want to apply this policy to.
. Create a CR with `allowedServices` set to specify the services allowed on the {service-network}.
. Create and apply the CR.

For example, the following CR allows users to expose and consume services with the prefix `backend-` for all namespaces: 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: allowedServices
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowedServices: ['^backend-']
----

NOTE: When exposing services, use the `--address <name>` parameter of the `skupper` CLI to name services appropriately.


// Type: procedure
[id="allowedExposedResources"] 
=== Implement a policy to allow specific resources

Use `allowedExposedResources` to specify which resources can be exposed on the {service-network}.

.Procedure

. Determine which namespaces you want to apply this policy to.
. Create a CR with `allowedExposedResources` set to specify resources that can be exposed on the {service-network}.
. Create and apply the CR.

For example, the following CR allows you expose an `nginx` deployment for all namespaces: 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: allowedExposedResources
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowedExposedResources: ['deployment/nginx']
----

NOTE: For `allowedExposedResources`, each entry must conform to the `type/name` syntax.
