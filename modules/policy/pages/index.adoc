= Securing a {service-network} using policies

include::{mod-loc}preface.adoc[]

By default, {skupper-name} includes many security features, including using mutual TLS for all {service-network} communication between sites.
By default, applying the {policy-system} to a cluster prevents all {service-network} communication to and from that cluster.
You specify granular policies to allow only the {service-network} communication you require.

NOTE: The {policy-system} is distinct from the `network-policy` option which restricts access to {skupper-name} services to the current namespace as described in {skupperclibooklink}.

Each site in a {service-network} runs a {skupper-router} and has a private, dedicated certificate authority (CA).
Communication between sites is secured with mutual TLS, so the {service-network} is isolated from external access, preventing security risks such as lateral attacks, malware infestations, and data exfiltration.
The {policy-system} adds another layer at a cluster level to help a cluster administrator control access to a {service-network}.

This guide assumes that you understand the following {skupper-name} concepts:

site:: A namespace in which {skupper-name} is installed.
token:: A token is required to establish a link between two sites. 
{service-network}:: After exposing services using {skupper-name}, you have created a {service-network}.

// Type: concept
[id="about-skupper-policies"] 
== About the {policy-system}

After a cluster administrator installs the {policy-system} using a Custom Resource Definition (CRD), the cluster administrator needs to configure one or more policies to allow _developers_ create and use services on the {service-network}.

NOTE: In this guide, _developers_ refers to users of a cluster who have access to a namespace, but do not have administrator privileges.

A cluster administrator configures one or more of following items using custom resources (CRs) to enable communication:

Allow incoming links:: Use `allowIncomingLinks` to enable developers create tokens and configure incoming links.

Allow outgoing links to specific hosts:: Use `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames` to specify hosts that developers can create links to.

Allow services:: Use `allowedServices` to specify which services developers can create or use on the {service-network}.

Allow resources to be exposed:: Use `allowedExposedResources` to specify which resources a developer can expose on the {service-network}.

NOTE: A cluster administrator can apply each policy CR setting to one or more namespaces.

For example, the following policy CR fully allows all {skupper-name} capabilities on all namespaces, except for:

* only allows outgoing links to any domain ending in `.example.com`.
* only allows 'deployment/nginx' resources to be exposed on the {service-network}.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: cluster-policy-sample-01
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowIncomingLinks: true
  allowedExposedResources:
    - "deployment/nginx"
  allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames: [".*\\.example.com$"]
  allowedServices:
    - "*"
----

[NOTE]
====
You can apply many policy CRs, and if there are conflicts in the items allowed, the most permissive policy is applied.
For example, if you apply an additional policy CR with the line `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames: []`, which does not list any hostnames, outgoing links to `*.example.com` are still permitted because that is permitted in the original CR.
====

`namespaces`:: One or more patterns to specify the namespaces that this policy applies to.
Note that you can use link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/[Label selectors] to match the namespaces.

`allowIncomingLinks`:: Specify `true` to allow other sites create links to the specified namespaces.

`allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames`:: Specify one or more patterns to determine which hosts you can create links to from the specified namespaces.

`allowedServices`:: Specify one or more patterns to determine the permitted names of services allowed on the {service-network} from the specified namespaces.

`allowedExposedResources`:: Specify one or more permitted names of resources allowed on the {service-network} from the specified namespaces. 
Note that patterns are not supported. 

[TIP]
====
Use regular expressions to create pattern matches, for example:

* `.*\\.com$` matches any string ending in `.com`.
A double backslash is required to avoid issues in YAML.
* `^abc$` matches the string `abc`.

====

If you create another CR that allows outgoing links for a specific namespace, a user can create a link from that namespace to join a {service-network}. That is, the logic for multiple policy CRs is `OR`.
An operation is permitted if any single policy CR permits the operation.

// Type: procedure
[id="installing-crd"] 
== Installing the {policy-system} CRD

Installing the {policy-system} CRD enables a cluster administrator to enforce policies for {service-network}s.

NOTE: If there are existing sites on the cluster, see xref:installing-crd-existing-sites[] to avoid {service-network} disruption.

.Prerequisites

* Access to a cluster using a `cluster-admin` account
* The Skupper operator is installed

.Procedure

. Log in to the cluster using a `cluster-admin` account.

. Download the CRD:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skupperproject/skupper/1.0/api/types/crds/skupper_cluster_policy_crd.yaml
----

. Apply the CRD:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f skupper_cluster_policy_crd.yaml

customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/skupperclusterpolicies.skupper.io created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/skupper-service-controller created
----


. To verify that the {policy-system} is active, use the `skupper status` command and check that the output includes the following line:
+
[source,bash]
----
Skupper is enabled for namespace "<namespace>" in interior mode (with policies).

// Type: procedure
[id="upgrading-existing-sites"] 
== Upgrading on a cluster with existing sites

If you are upgrading sites from {skupper-name} version 0.8, you can take advantage of the lack of a {policy-system} in that version and avoid {service-network} disruption.

.Procedure

. Document each service and exposed resources.

. Create policy CRs as described in xref:creating-policies[]

. Install the CRD as described in xref:installing-crd[].

. Grant permissions to read policies to developers to avoid that site being blocked from the {service-network}.
+
--
For each site namespace:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding skupper-service-controller-<namespace> --clusterrole=skupper-service-controller --serviceaccount=<namespace>:skupper-service-controller
----

where `<namespace>` is the site namespace.
--

endif::skupper-io[]

// Type: procedure
[id="installing-crd-existing-sites"] 
== Installing the {policy-system} CRD on a cluster with existing sites

If the cluster already hosts {skupper-name} sites, note the following before installing the CRD:

* All existing connections are closed. 
You must apply a policy CR to reopen connections.
* All existing {service-network} services and exposed resources are removed. 
You must create those resources again.

ifdef::skupper-io[]
NOTE: If you are upgrading sites from {skupper-name} version 0.8, you can take advantage of the lack of a {policy-system} in that version and avoid {service-network} disruption by following the procedure described in xref:upgrading-existing-sites[].
endif::skupper-io[]

.Procedure

To avoid disruption:

. Plan the CRD deployment for an appropriate time.

. Search your cluster for sites:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector=app=skupper
----

. Document each service and resource exposed on the {service-network}.

. Install the CRD as described in xref:installing-crd[].
This step closes connections and removes all {service-network} services and exposed resources.

. If {skupper-name} sites exist in the cluster not created by `cluster-admin`, you must grant permissions to read policies to developers to avoid that site being blocked from the {service-network}.
+
--
For each site namespace:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding skupper-service-controller-<namespace> --clusterrole=skupper-service-controller --serviceaccount=<namespace>:skupper-service-controller
----

where `<namespace>` is the site namespace.
--


. Create policy CRs as described in xref:creating-policies[]

. Recreate any services and exposed resources as required.


// Type: procedure
[id="creating-policies"] 
== Creating policies for the {policy-system}

Policies allow a cluster administrator to control communication across the {service-network} from a cluster.


.Prerequisites

* Access to a cluster using a `cluster-admin` account.
* The {policy-system} CRD is installed on the cluster.

.Procedure

NOTE: Typically, you create a policy CR that combines many elements from the steps below. See xref:about-skupper-policies[] for an example CR.

. xref:allowIncomingLinks[]
. xref:allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames[]
. xref:allowedServices[]
. xref:allowedExposedResources[]

// Type: procedure
[id="allowIncomingLinks"] 
=== Implement a policy to allow incoming links

Use `allowIncomingLinks` to enable developers create tokens and configure incoming links.

.Procedure

. Determine which namespaces you want to apply this policy to.
. Create a CR with `allowIncomingLinks` set to `true` or `false`.
. Create and apply the CR.

For example, the following CR allows incoming links for all namespaces: 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: allowincominglinks
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowIncomingLinks: true
----




// Type: procedure
[id="allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames"] 
=== Implement a policy to allow outgoing links to specific hosts

Use `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames` to specify hosts that developers can create links to.
You cannot create a `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames` policy to disallow a specific host that was previously allowed.

. Determine which namespaces you want to apply this policy to.
. Create a CR with `allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames` set to a pattern of allowed hosts.
. Create and apply the CR.

For example, the following CR allows links to all subdomains of `example.com` for all namespaces: 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: allowedoutgoinglinkshostnames
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowedOutgoingLinksHostnames: ['.*\\.example\\.com']
----


// Type: procedure
[id="allowedServices"] 
=== Implement a policy to allow specific services

Use `allowedServices` to specify which services a developer can create or use on the {service-network}.
You cannot create a `allowedServices` policy to disallow a specific service that was previously allowed.

.Procedure

. Determine which namespaces you want to apply this policy to.
. Create a CR with `allowedServices` set to specify the services allowed on the {service-network}.
. Create and apply the CR.

For example, the following CR allows users to expose and consume services with the prefix `backend-` for all namespaces: 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: allowedservices
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowedServices: ['^backend-']
----

NOTE: When exposing services, you can use the `--address <name>` parameter of the `skupper` CLI to name services to match your policy.


// Type: procedure
[id="allowedExposedResources"] 
=== Implement a policy to allow specific resources

Use `allowedExposedResources` to specify which resources a developer can expose on the {service-network}.
You cannot create a `allowedExposedResources` policy to disallow a specific resource that was previously allowed.

.Procedure

. Determine which namespaces you want to apply this policy to.
. Create a CR with `allowedExposedResources` set to specify resources that a developer can expose on the {service-network}.
. Create and apply the CR.

For example, the following CR allows you to expose an `nginx` deployment for all namespaces: 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skupper.io/v1alpha1
kind: SkupperClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: allowedexposedresources
spec:
  namespaces:
    - "*"
  allowedExposedResources: ['deployment/nginx']
----

NOTE: For `allowedExposedResources`, each entry must conform to the `type/name` syntax.

// Type: procedure
[id="exploring-policies"] 
== Exploring the current policies for a cluster

As a developer you might want to check which policies are enforced for a particular site.

.Procedure

. Log into a namespace where a {skupper-name} site has been initialized.

. Check whether incoming links are permitted:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl exec deploy/skupper-service-controller -- get policies incominglink

ALLOWED POLICY ENABLED ERROR                                                   ALLOWED BY 
false   true           Policy validation error: incoming links are not allowed 
----
+
In this example incoming links are not allowed by policy.

. Explore other policies:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl exec deploy/skupper-service-controller -- get policies 
Validates existing policies

Usage:
  get policies [command]

Available Commands:
  expose       Validates if the given resource can be exposed
  incominglink Validates if incoming links can be created
  outgoinglink Validates if an outgoing link to the given hostname is allowed
  service      Validates if service can be created or imported
----

As shown, there are commands to check each policy type by specifying what you want to do, for example, to check if you can expose an nginx deployment:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl  exec deploy/skupper-service-controller -- get policies expose deployment nginx
ALLOWED POLICY ENABLED ERROR                                                       ALLOWED BY 
false   true           Policy validation error: deployment/nginx cannot be exposed            
----

If you allowed an nginx deployment as described in xref:allowedExposedResources[], the same command shows that the resource is allowed and displays the name of the policy CR that enabled it:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl  exec deploy/skupper-service-controller -- get policies expose deployment nginx
ALLOWED POLICY ENABLED ERROR                                                       ALLOWED BY 
true    true                                                                       allowedexposedresources
