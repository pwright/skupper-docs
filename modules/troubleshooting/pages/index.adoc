= Troubleshooting a {service-network}

[role="system:abstract"]
Typically, you can create a {service-network} without referencing this troubleshooting guide.
However, this guide provides some tips for situations when the {service-network} does not perform as expected.

// tag::skupper-io[]
See xref:common-problems[] if you have encountered a specific issue using the `skupper` CLI.
// end::skupper-io[]

A typical troubleshooting workflow is to check all the sites and create debug tar files.

== Checking sites

[role="system:abstract"]
Using the `skupper` command-line interface (CLI) provides a simple method to get started with troubleshooting {skupper-name}.

.Procedure

. Check the site status:
+
--
----
$ skupper status --namespace west

Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is connected to 2 other sites. It has 1 exposed services.
----

The output shows:

* A site exists in the specified namespace.
* A link exists to two other sites.
* A service is exposed on the {service-network} and is accessible from this namespace.

--

. Check the {service-network}:
+
--
----
$ skupper network status --namespace west

Sites:
├─ [local] 05f8c38 - west 
│  URL: 10.110.15.54
│  mode: interior
│  name: west
│  namespace: west
│  version: 1.0.2
│  ╰─ Services:
│     ╰─ name: backend
│        address: backend: 8080
│        protocol: tcp
╰─ [remote] 1537b82 - east 
   URL: 10.97.26.100
   name: east
   namespace: east
   sites linked to: 05f8c38-west
   version: 1.0.2
   ╰─ Services:
      ╰─ name: backend
         address: backend: 8080
         protocol: tcp
         ╰─ Targets:
            ├─ name: backend-77f8f45fc8-smckp
            ├─ name: backend-77f8f45fc8-gh6tp
            ╰─ name: backend-77f8f45fc8-m58tg
----

NOTE: If the output is not what you expected, you might want to xref:checking-links[check links] before proceeding.

The output shows:

* There are 2 sites on the {service-network}, `east` and `west`.
* Details for each site, for example the namespace names.
* The original services that are exposed (Targets), in this case the three backend services exposed using the `tcp` protocol.
* The services available on the {service-network}, including the port number. For example, `backend:8080`. 
--

. Check the status of services exposed on the {service-network}:
+
--
----
$ skupper service status
Services exposed through Skupper:
╰─ backend (tcp port 8080)
   ╰─ Targets:
      ╰─ app=backend name=backend
----

The output shows the `backend` service and the related target of that service.

NOTE: The related targets for services are only displayed when the target is available on the current cluster.
--

. List the events for a site:
+

The output shows sites being linked and a service being exposed on a {service-network}.
However, this output is most useful when reporting an issue and is included in the {skupper-name} debug tar file.

// Type: procedure
[id='checking-links']
== Checking links

You must link sites before you can expose services on the {service-network}.
This section outlines some advanced options for checking links.


. Check the link status:
+
--
----
$ skupper link status --namespace east

Links created from this site:
-------------------------------
Link link1 is active
----

A link exists from the specified site to another site, meaning a token from another site was applied to the specified site.

NOTE: Running `skupper link status` on a connected site produces output only if a token was used to create a link.   

If you use this command on a site where you did not create the link, but there is an incoming link to the site:
----
$ skupper link status --namespace west

Links created from this site:
-------------------------------
There are no links configured or active

Currently active links from other sites:
----------------------------------------
A link from the namespace east on site east(536695a9-26dc-4448-b207-519f56e99b71) is active 
----
--

. Check the verbose link status:
+
--
----
$ skupper link status link1 --verbose --namespace east

 Cost:          1
 Created:       2022-10-24 12:50:33 +0100 IST
 Name:          link1
 Namespace:     east
 Site:          east-536695a9-26dc-4448-b207-519f56e99b71
 Status:        Active
----

The output shows detail about the link, including a timestamp of when the link was created and the associated relative cost of using the link.

The status of the link must be `Active` to allow service traffic.

== Creating a {skupper-name} debug tar file

The debug tar file contains all the logs from the {skupper-name} components for a site and provides detailed information to help debug issues.

. Create the debug tar file:
+
----
$  skupper debug dump my-site

Skupper dump details written to compressed archive:  `my-site.tar.gz`
----

. You can expand the file using the following command:
+
--
----
$ tar -xvf kind-site.tar.gz

These files can be used to provide support for {skupper-name}, however some items you can check:

versions:: See `*versions.txt` for the versions of various components.

ingress:: See `skupper-site-configmap.yaml` to determine the `ingress` type for the site.

linking and services:: See the `skupper-service-controller-*-events.txt` file to view details of token usage and service exposure.

== Resolving common problems

The following issues and workarounds might help you debug simple scenarios when evaluating {skupper-name}.

*Cannot initialize skupper*

If the `skupper init` command fails, consider the following options:

* Check the load balancer.
+
--
If you are evaluating {skupper-name} on minikube, use the following command to create a load balancer:

----
$ minikube tunnel
----

For other Kubernetes flavors, see the documentation from your provider.

--

* Initialize without ingress.
+
--
This option prevents other sites from linking to this site, but linking outwards is supported.
Once a link is established, traffic can flow in either direction.
Enter the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ skupper init --ingress none
----

[NOTE]
====
See xref:cli-reference:skupper_init.adoc[] for more options.
====

--

*Cannot link sites*

To link two sites, one site must be accessible from the other site.
For example, if one site is behind a firewall and the other site is on an AWS cluster, you must:

. Create a token on the AWS cluster site.

. Create the link on the site inside the firewall.

[NOTE]
====
By default, a token is only valid for a single link.
If you need to link many sites, create separate tokens for each link.
====

*Cannot access Skupper console*

Use `skupper status` to find the console URL.

Use the following command to display the password for the `admin` user:doctype: article

----
$ kubectl get secret/skupper-console-users -o jsonpath={.data.admin} | base64 -d
----

*Cannot create a token for linking clusters*

You might see the following note after using the `skupper token create` command:

----
Token written to <path> (Note: token will only be valid for local cluster)
----

This output indicates that the site was deployed without an ingress option. For example `skupper init --ingress none`.
You must specify an ingress to allow sites on other clusters to link to your site.

You can also use the `skupper token create` command to check if an ingress was specified when the site was created.
// end::skupper-io[]
