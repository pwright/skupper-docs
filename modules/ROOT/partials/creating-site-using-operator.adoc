== Creating a site using the Skupper Operator


. Create a YAML file defining the ConfigMap of the site you want to create.
+
--
For example, create `skupper-site.yaml`:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: skupper-site
  namespace: my-namespace
----

You can later retrieve the console credentials as described in {ConsoleLink} or specify them now by adding the username and optionally the password to `skupper-site.yaml` as follows:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
data:
  console-user: "admin"
  console-password: "changeme"
----
--

. Apply the YAML to create a ConfigMap named `skupper-site` in the namespace you want to use:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ kubectl apply -f skupper-site.yaml
----

. Verify that the site is created by checking that the Skupper router and service controller pods are running:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
skupper-router-8c6cc6d76-27562                1/1     Running   0          40s
skupper-service-controller-57cdbb56c5-vc7s2   1/1     Running   0          34s
----

NOTE: If you deployed the Operator to a single namespace, an additional site controller pod is also running.
