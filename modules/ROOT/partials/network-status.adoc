= Exploring a {service-network}

{skupper-name} includes a command to allow you report all the sites and the services available on a {service-network}.

.Prerequisites

* A {service-network} with more than one site

.Procedure

. Set your Kubernetes context to a namespace on the {service-network}.

. Use the following command to report the status of the {service-network}:
+
--

[source,bash]
----
$ skupper network status
----

For example, the following shows the output for the {service-network} created from the {OpenShiftTutoriallink} tutorial from the `west` namespace:

[source]
----
Sites:
├─ [local] 4dba248 - west  <1>
│  URL: 10.96.146.236 <2>
│  name: west <3>
│  namespace: west
│  version: 0.8.6 <4>
│  ╰─ Services:
│     ╰─ name: hello-world-backend <5>
│        address: hello-world-backend: 8080 <6>
│        protocol: tcp <7>
╰─ [remote] bca99d1 - east <8> 
   URL: 
   name: east
   namespace: east
   sites linked to: 4dba248-west <9>
   version: 0.8.6
   ╰─ Services:
      ╰─ name: hello-world-backend
         address: hello-world-backend: 8080
         protocol: tcp
         ╰─ Targets:
            ╰─ name: hello-world-backend-7dfb45b98d-mhskw <10>

<1> The unique identifier of the site associated with the current context, that is, the `west` namespace

<2> The URL of the {service-network} router.
This is required for other sites to connect to this site and is different from the console URL. 
If you require the URL of the console, use the `skupper status` command to display that URL.

<3> The site name.
By default, skupper uses the name of the current namespace.
If you want to specify a site name, use `skupper init  --site-name <site-name>`.

<4> The version of {skupper-name} running the site.
The site version can be different from the current `skupper` CLI version.
To update a site to the version of the CLI, use `skupper update`.

<5> The name of a service exposed on the {service-network}.

<6> The address of a service exposed on the {service-network}.

<7> The protocol of a service exposed on the {service-network}.

<8> The unique identifier of a remote site on the {service-network}.

<9> The sites that the remote site is linked to.

<10> The name of the local Kubernetes object that is exposed on the {service-network}.
In this example, this is the `hello-world-backend` pod.

[NOTE]
====
The URL for the east site has no value because that site was initialized without ingress using the following command:
----
$ skupper init --ingress none
