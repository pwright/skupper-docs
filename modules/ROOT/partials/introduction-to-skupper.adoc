ifdef::skupper-io[:image-prefix: ROOT:]

{skupper-name} introduces a {service-network}, linking services across the hybrid cloud.

A {service-network} enables communication between services running in different network locations. 
It allows geographically distributed services to connect as if they were all running in the same site.

image::{image-prefix}overview.svg["This diagram shows a 'service network' connecting two Kubernetes clusters. The Skupper site in Namespace A, in the left cluster, has a deployment which exposes a TCP service to the service network. In the right cluster two sites can use that service as if the service existed in the right cluster."]

For example, you can deploy your frontend in a public {kubernetes-flavor} cluster and deploy your backend in a private {kubernetes-flavor} cluster, then connect them into a {service-network}.

A {service-network} provides the following features:

* Security by default. All inter-site traffic is protected by mutual TLS using a private, dedicated certificate authority (CA).
* Easy connections between {kubernetes-flavor} clusters, even private clusters.
* A {service-network} supports existing TCP-based applications without requiring modification.
* Monitor your application traffic spread across multiple {kubernetes-flavor} clusters using the {service-network} console.

You deploy and manage a {service-network} using the `skupper` CLI.
